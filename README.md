# Scala.js-TensorFlow.js #

This projects aims to provide [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) facades for [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/),
 enabling you to create neural networks with Scala that run and can be trained with GPU acceleration in your browser.

This is WIP and still at an early stage. The tfjs-core bindings are almost done. You can create tensors and run
operations on them. See the example project.

Support for tfjs-layers coming soon!
